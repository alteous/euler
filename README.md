# euler

An experimental and opinionated mathematics library for computer graphics.

## Project ideas

 * No distinction between 'point' and 'vector' types.
 * GLSL-like constructors for vectors and matrices.
 * `vec3` is actually a `vec4` with a fixed zero `w` co-ordinate.
 * All units are in radians. Let the user convert as necessary.
 * All types are base `f32`.
