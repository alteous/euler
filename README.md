# euler

An experimental mathematics library for computer graphics.

## Project ideas

 * Strictly 3D.
 * No distinction between 'point' and 'vector' types.
 * No need to import traits or modules for most functionality.
 * GLSL-like constructors for vectors and matrices.
 * All angles are in radians.
 * All types are base `f32`.
 * Adding two homogeneous 4D vectors is not allowed.
